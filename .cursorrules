# AI Behavior Rules

## Commit Conventions
You must follow the Conventional Commits specification for all git commit messages and PR titles.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

Supported types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `build`: Changes to build system or dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

## Pre-commit Checks
- The project uses `husky` to run `pnpm lint` (Biome) on pre-commit.
- Ensure all code is linted and formatted before attempting to commit.

## Language
- Always communicate and generate code/commits in English (unless instructed otherwise).

# Specification Quality Checklist: Product Search and Listing (Catalog Search)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-11-29  
**Feature**: `specs/001-catalog-search/spec.md`

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (except for items explicitly marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All previously open clarification points (empty submissions, loading behavior between searches, and trending category click behavior) have been resolved in the specification.
- The spec is ready to be used as input for `/speckit.plan` and subsequent implementation work.
